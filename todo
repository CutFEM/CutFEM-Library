To Do

DONE ** 2) fixer le problem de innerproduct dans Curvature
3) changer R2 * ItemVF to build real scalar product
DONE ** 4) take away levelset in BaseCutProblem
DONE ** 5) Tester d'inverser boucle des quadratures space <-> Time et comparer temps.
DONE ** 6) take away interface from CutFEM problem. We can use the one in the CutFESpace directly!!!
DONE ** 6 bis) give interface to integrate on surface and change name to just addBilinear
DONE ** 7) Overload ^ for adding class Parameter power and be able to do (h^3)
DONE ** 8) add a class tool for computing femFun (op whatd w etc)
DONE ** 9) ListItemVF must be all protected and friend with innerProduct because we dont want to be able to build it.
DONE **    Because it will be a problem if creating temporary object such as ProductFunFEM
DONE ** 10)   ListItemVF& operator- () --- this should return a new object!!!!!!
DONE ** 11) add space in funTest so we can have different spaces
DONE ** 12) build problwm with many spaces and have them one on each other just having an idx0 array to now where to start
DONE ** 13) having the array in the FunTest to store the solution
DONE ** 14) CLEAN ITEMVF.hpp
DONE ** 16) take away all the basisFun to use the bfdata array
17) changer kb = Vh->Th(FK.T) to Vh.idxElementInBackMesh(k);
DONE ** 18) save solution called from FESpace with map as input
DONE ** 19) changer saveSolution et initSolution pour que ce soit plus general
DONE ** 21) Need to add the mapping for the curvature terms
22) Check P3 element because doesnt work with mapping, maybe because use of Vh.nbnode so edge nodes are sharing deformation
DONE ** 23) Only use of expressionFunFEM in (,). no Fun in testFunction anymore, only expression
DONE ** 24) Remove degre() method in finite element classes. It is just an artefact from old stuff
DONE ** 25) create computeCoef, computeCoefBorder, computeCoefInterface, etc to be able to compute correclty all coefficient
26) In border integral, change measOnB = nb_face_onB*meas; to have it inside the
    loop, so it is exact not just using the meas of the considered face (faces can have different measure)
DONE ** 27) change getcoeffU,V to have a unique one that compute both directly
28) all expression function should be call on backMesh even in FEM (in the integral functions)
29) in integrals, change Vh->backSpace->Th[kb] when getting the partition of the cut element
30) study convergence of projection on interface (which h power do we need)
DONE ** 31) change the cutFem parameter thing. Not by name but maybe by pointer. To be able to do h^p
32) what_part in Partition should be more general, not only (-1, 1) subdomain. We want a cutDomain with -1 only for example.
33) NEED TO CHANGE SET VELOCITY IN NAVIER STOKES PROBLEM.
DONE ** 34) ADD normal in function evaluation in on edges and boundary integrals
35) !!! REMOVE SOME OF THE OPERATION CLASS FOR EXPRESSION AND USE TESTFUNCTION INSTEAD !!!!
36) FIX BUG WHEN DECLARE SAME CUTFEM_PARAMETER IN 2 FUNCTION => SEGFAULT.
37) WHEN ADDING A INTERFACE, NEED TO PASS AN OPERATOR TO SAY WHAT TO DO ( *, min, max etc)
38) change addFaceStab for macro to addBilinear , inner_edge, macro_element
DONE ** 39) Have a common root class for the macro class
DONE ** 40) take away addEdgeIntegral and replace with addBilinear
DONE ** 41) add norm function working like integrals.
42) Interface should build a partition directly, not sending just the cutData.
43) make gnuplot.cpp
44) check grad lambda in quad to see if its like for tet
45) in interface_levelSet we should only have one ls<double> and note byte
46) A class Analytcal_Fun virtual and derived class for each kind of input fun.
    Then an eval pure virtual method is implemennted
    Some static const bool variable cut, time, etc to check is the function given by the user is acceptable by the function
47) create class for problem solved in validated in cutFEM, with optimiza build matrix
48)CONVENTION NAME
class => ClassName
class fun ==> FunctionName
class accessor =>  set_variable
class variable => name_
struct variable => name
varaible => variable_name
DONE ** 49) Add array with inner edge in class
50) Add interface_marker. try to build swedish flag :)
DONE ** 51) template macro class and use only mesh, no space
52) try to make a surface macro 3D picture
DONE ** 53) take away cutTh de paraview class and just be able to add many files without new object
54) try P1isoP1 elements
55) in testFunction operator , use nextDerivative and not D()
56) all evaluation should on the backMesh (kb, id_dom)
57) should give a mesh in addIntegralFunction so it is clear where we integrate, if
    mixt terms are being used ...
58) the rhs in problem should be private. BIG TROUBLE IF POINTING ON IT BEFORE IT IS RESIZE BY LAGRANGE MULTIPLIER eg
59) Change ls to an struct eval coming from the interface representation or maybe just create and save the nodes
60) remove whichDomain + other function renamed
61) change Rd::Khat from dataStuct to Rd.hpp files
62) add   R2 toReferenceElement(const R1& P, int i) const; and other for quad and hexa
62) remove doublon dans datastuct files

63) add domain_id in itemVF and fixe onDomain in the integration function and on interface integrals
64) Update gnuplot file with new classes
65) Fixe general norm file with new classes
