To Do

DONE ** 2) fixer le problem de innerproduct dans Curvature
3) changer R2 * ItemVF to build real scalar product
3) add Parameter*Fun in innerProduct
DONE ** 4) take away levelset in BaseCutProblem
DONE ** 5) Tester d'inverser boucle des quadratures space <-> Time et comparer temps.
DONE ** 6) take away interface from CutFEM problem. We can use the one in the CutFESpace directly!!!
DONE ** 6 bis) give interface to integrate on surface and change name to just addBilinear
DONE ** 7) Overload ^ for adding class Parameter power and be able to do (h^3)
DONE ** 8) add a class tool for computing femFun (op whatd w etc)
DONE ** 9) ListItemVF must be all protected and friend with innerProduct because we dont want to be able to build it.
DONE **    Because it will be a problem if creating temporary object such as ProductFunFEM
10)   ListItemVF& operator- () --- this should return a new object!!!!!!
DONE ** 11) add space in funTest so we can have different spaces
DONE ** 12) build problwm with many spaces and have them one on each other just having an idx0 array to now where to start
DONE ** 13) having the array in the FunTest to store the solution
DONE ** 14) CLEAN ITEMVF.hpp
DONE ** 16) take away all the basisFun to use the bfdata array
17) changer kb = Vh->Th(FK.T) to Vh.idxElementInBackMesh(k);
DONE ** 18) save solution called from FESpace with map as input
DONE ** 19) changer saveSolution et initSolution pour que ce soit plus general
DONE ** 21) Need to add the mapping for the curvature terms
22) Check P3 element because doesnt work with mapping, maybe because use of Vh.nbnode so edge nodes are sharing deformation
DONE ** 23) Only use of expressionFunFEM in (,). no Fun in testFunction anymore, only expression
DONE ** 24) Remove degre() method in finite element classes. It is just an artefact from old stuff
DONE ** 25) create computeCoef, computeCoefBorder, computeCoefInterface, etc to be able to compute correclty all coefficient
26) In border integral, change measOnB = nb_face_onB*meas; to have it inside the
    loop, so it is exact not just using the meas of the considered face (faces can have different measure)
DONE ** 27) change getcoeffU,V to have a unique one that compute both directly
28) all expression function should be call on backMesh even in FEM (in the integral functions)
29) in integrals, change Vh->backSpace->Th[kb] when getting the partition of the cut element
30) study convergence of projection on interface (which h power do we need)
DONE ** 31) change the cutFem parameter thing. Not by name but maybe by pointer. To be able to do h^p
32) what_part in Partition should be more general, not only (-1, 1) subdomain. We want a cutDomain with -1 only for example.
33) NEED TO CHANGE SET VELOCITY IN NAVIER STOKES PROBLEM.
